Interpretable Gradient Boosting - Real Estate House Price Prediction
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Installation instructions I followed: 
I installed Docker and WSL2 through the links provided on the repo-website, https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10. I already had VSC installed but needed to install the Docker and WSL extensions. I made a new repository on GitHub and cloned it to my desktop (along with adding my ssh-key to .git/config). I created app.py and Dockerfile to test my setup. It worked in a sufficient manner, but I am unsure where WSL2 comes into play in this setup.
